# Edit_Propagation_via_Color_Palettes

The project still needs to be modified, and the current code is not perfect.

This only contains code for editing and spreading using existing images and corresponding palettes. The code for palette extraction can be obtained from [palette-refine](https://github.com/amberwangyili/palette-refine)

Please download [Qt-Color-Widgets](https://gitlab.com/mattbas/Qt-Color-Widgets) and place it under `include/Qt-Color-Widgets` to complete the code.
